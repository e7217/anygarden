"""Static catalog of engine models and reasoning levels.

Last refreshed: 2026-04-25 against the locally-installed CLIs
(``claude`` 2.1.116, ``codex`` 0.121.0, ``gemini`` 0.37.1). Values were
verified by probing ``--help``, triggering validation errors, and
reading the shipped binaries' model-name tables — not by trusting the
vendor marketing docs, which lag behind the actual CLIs.

Exception: ``gpt-5.5`` (codex) was added on the 2026-04-25
announcement and is not yet round-tripped against a live ``codex exec``
call. If ChatGPT-account auth rejects it at runtime, roll the
``default_model`` back to ``gpt-5.4`` — Codex does no client-side
validation, so the catalog can advertise an ID the backend then refuses.

This is intentionally a hand-maintained dict rather than a live query
against each SDK/CLI. Reasons:

- Several engines (Codex CLI, Claude Code SDK) do not expose a clean
  "list models" API that works without a valid API key. Walking an HTTP
  endpoint per admin page load is a usability regression compared to a
  static dict.
- Reasoning-effort taxonomies differ per engine *at the CLI layer*:
  Codex allows ``none/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh``; Claude Code uses
  ``low/medium/high/xhigh/max`` (``--effort`` flag); Gemini CLI has no
  effort flag — the adapter translates ``low/medium/high`` into the
  ``--thinking-budget`` integer instead. The catalog encodes what the
  UI should show per engine.
- A stale entry here is a trivial PR, not a runtime failure — the
  agent spawn still works because the adapter falls back to its
  built-in default when the requested model is unknown. Codex in
  particular does no client-side model-id validation at all.

Follow-up work (issue #4) may add a dynamic refresh endpoint that
queries the Anthropic/OpenAI/Google SDKs for live model lists and
merges them with this static baseline.
